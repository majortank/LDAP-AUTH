## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. These variables are stored in a `.env` file. An example of this file, `.env.example`, is included in the project. 

Here are the environment variables used in this project:

### LDAP Settings

- `AUTH_LDAP_SERVER_URI`: This is the URI of your LDAP server. Replace `your_ldap_server_uri` with the actual URI.

- `AUTH_LDAP_BIND_DN`: This is the Distinguished Name (DN) to bind to the LDAP server. Replace `your_ldap_bind_dn` with the actual DN.

- `AUTH_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD`: This is the password to bind to the LDAP server. Replace `your_ldap_bind_password` with the actual password.

To use these variables, copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` and replace the placeholders with your actual values.

# Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   Use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```shellscript
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:

   ```shellscript
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**

   Depending on the programming language and the package manager used in the project, you will need to install the dependencies. For example, if the project uses Node.js and npm, you would use:

   ```shellscript
   npm install
   ```

   Or if the project uses Python and pip, you would use:

   ```shellscript
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the environment variables**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`:

   ```shellscript
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then, open the `.env` file and replace the placeholders with your actual values.

5. **Run the project**

   The command to run the project will depend on the programming language and the framework used. For example, if the project uses Node.js and Express, you might use:

   ```shellscript
   npm start
   ```

   Or if the project uses Python and Django, you might use:

   ```shellscript
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Please replace `<repository_url>` and `<project_directory>` with the actual URL of the repository and the name of the project directory, respectively.
